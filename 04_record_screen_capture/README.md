# Intermediate - Record Screen Capture

## Introduction

When the speaker is using a Mac, you can easily record their screen activities. This way, you get very sharp and high quality recording. This option is rather intrusive. So only do this if you meet the speaker earlier and make the arrangements before the start of his talk.

## Steps
1. Start QuickTime Player

3. Set the audio source of the video to "Build-In Microphone: Internal Microphone". This is to ensure you capture the speaker's voice together with the video.
