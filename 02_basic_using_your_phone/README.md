# Basic - Using your phone

## Introduction

The easiest way of capturing meetup videos is to with your phone's camera. The image quality is good and the sound quality can be pretty decent. Phones are build to capture audio surprisingly well. This is probably also the cheapest way to do so. 

You can upload the video after the meetup is over by uploading to your computer and the use the YouTube upload page to upload the file. Fortunately there is an app that can let you record and upload to your YouTube Channel directly from the phone, the [YouTube Capture](https://www.youtube.com/capture) app. Unfortunately, it is an iOS only app.

## Steps

1. Download the [YouTube Capture app](https://www.youtube.com/capture). *(Sorry, iOS only)*

## Example Footages

Notice the footage is very shaky. Notice the video faded in and out somewhere in the middle. This because i accidentally covered the microphone on the phone. :(*
