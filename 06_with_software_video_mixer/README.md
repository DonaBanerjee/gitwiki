# Advanced - With Software Video Mixer

## Introduction

This option has everything you see in [Advanced - Camera and Screen Grabber](../05_camera_and_screen_grabber) but re-arranged to connect to a single hub - a Windows Laptop.

This option does not require any post-production. The video is mixed live during the talk. This reduces turn-around time for a video and you can probaly upload it the same night as you did the recording.

## The Software Video Mixer

The software video mixer is called [Xsplit Broadcaster](https://www.xsplit.com/products/broadcaster?lang=en). This software requires a monthly subscription of [US$4.95](https://www.xsplit.com/buy/index?pp=WWW_NAVBAR&lang=en).
