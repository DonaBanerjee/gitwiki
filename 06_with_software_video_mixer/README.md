# Advanced - With Software Video Mixer

## Introduction

This option has everything you see in [Advanced - Camera and Screen Grabber](../05_camera_and_screen_grabber) but re-arranged to connect to a single hub - a Windows Laptop.

This option does not require any post-production. The video is mixed live during the talk. This reduces turn-around time for a video and you can probaly upload it the same night as you did the recording.

## The Software Video Mixer

The software video mixer we use is called [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com). This software is free and open source. And it runs on Windows, Mac and Linux.

## Things to note

- Check your audio source.
- Make sure you didn't mute the microphone.
- Setup the scenes before hand.
- Background & splash images are nice.
- Shortcut keys do not always work as advertised. :(
