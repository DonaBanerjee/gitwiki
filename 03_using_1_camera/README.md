# Intermediate - Using 1 camera

## Introduction

For better sound quality, we prefer to use an external camera. You can get a consumer grade camera that records into a SD card or hard drive. These videos are easier to retrieve and do upload.

However, we also found some pretty easy to use digital cameras with professional grade microphones from Zoom. They shoot videos in high-def (720p, 1080p at 30 - 60 FPS). Very decent for recording meetups with clear crisp sound from the speaker.

## Steps
1. Shoot video on an external camera. Something that saves to a HDD or SD card. We recommend using the [Zoom Q4](http://www.zoom.co.jp/products/q4). Its costs SGD$409.50 at [City Music](http://www.citymusic.com.sg/webshaper/store/viewProd.asp?pkProductItem=1124). *(The tripod costs between $16 to $25 from Mustafa Centre)*.
